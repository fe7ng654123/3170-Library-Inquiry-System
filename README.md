# 3170-Library-Inquiry-System
JDBC Java Project
1. Introduction
You are required to implement a Library Inquiry System for a library so that all information about books in
the library, library users, and loans are stored. The system shall support interactive operations from
operators. You are required to use Java JDBC API to access the database. Our tutors will give a tutorial on
how to use the JDBC API. You are required to implement a Java command line application to realize all
system functions stated in this specification. There are two phases:
In phase 1, you are required to design the database for the system (including an ER-diagram and a
relational schema). After the deadline of Phase 1, a suggested solution will be provided. You are required
to use the suggested solution to complete Phase 2.
In Phase 2, you are required to implement the Library Inquiry System as a Java command-line program. Our tutors will give tutorials on how to connect to a MySQL database system with JDBC API and deploy
your work on the required platform. This is a group project and each group should have at most 3 members. ONLY one copy of solution is
required for each group. Please fill out the group registration form on the blackboard system before the
group registration deadline.
